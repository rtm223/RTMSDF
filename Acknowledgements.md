## Inigo Quilez SDF Resources
> [Inigo Quilez](https://www.patreon.com/inigoquilez) on Patreon, https://iquilezles.org/

The SDF visualizations I use (including those in the main banner images) are
based upon the ones that Inigo regualrly uses on
[Shadertoy](https://www.shadertoy.com/playlist/MXdSRf). I have adaped them
to have some additional readability around the isolines, but the core largely 
remains the same. It is a very good visualization, after all
